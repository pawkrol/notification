Project consist of three modules:
* Arduino code [branch: master-1]
* Spring REST server [branch: master-1]
* Android application [branch: master-2]

This allows to control LEDs connected to Arduino board through REST interface. 
Android application uses the REST service to communicate with Arduino.
